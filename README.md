# Coastal Town: Climate Crisis

A turn-based strategy game where you play as the manager of a coastal town trying to adapt to climate change. Experience the increasing challenges of climate adaptation through immersive visuals and strategic decision-making.

## Game Overview

In Coastal Town: Climate Crisis, you are the manager of a coastal town facing the growing threat of climate change. Your task is to manage the town's resources and implement adaptation projects to protect against increasingly severe weather events.

The game is designed to illustrate the difficult reality of climate adaptation: while we can delay and mitigate impacts, some climate change effects are now inevitable and will require ongoing resources and adaptation. No matter how well you plan, the town will eventually succumb to the effects of climate change. Your goal is to keep the town functioning for as long as possible.

## How to Play

### Running the Game

You can run the game in two simple ways:

- **Recommended method**: Double-click the `play-game.html` file to open the game in your default web browser
- **Alternative method**: Open `index.html` directly in any web browser

### Gameplay

1. **Build adaptation projects**: Use your town funds to build various adaptation projects like seawalls, levees, drainage systems, and more.
2. **End your turn**: Click the "End Turn" button to advance to the next year.
3. **Collect tax revenue**: Each turn, your town collects tax revenue based on its economic activity.
4. **Respond to events**: Each turn, climate events will occur that may damage your town and infrastructure.
5. **Repair damaged projects**: Damaged projects are less effective and cost more to maintain. Repair them when possible.
6. **Manage your budget**: Balance spending on new projects, repairs, and maintaining existing infrastructure.

## Game Mechanics

- **Town Funds**: You start with $1,000,000. When you run out of money, the game ends.
- **Tax Revenue**: Each turn, your town collects tax revenue based on its economic activity. More built projects increase tax revenue, while higher climate intensity reduces it.
- **Climate Intensity**: Increases over time, making events more frequent and severe.
- **Adaptation Projects**: Different projects protect against different types of climate events.
- **Maintenance Costs**: Built projects require ongoing maintenance each turn.
- **Project Damage**: Climate events can damage or destroy your projects, with visual feedback.
- **Weather Effects**: Experience visual representations of storms, flooding, and heatwaves.
- **Interactive Town Map**: Watch your town evolve as you build projects and face climate events.

## Strategy Tips

- Build a mix of projects to protect against different types of climate events.
- Prioritize repairing damaged infrastructure to maintain effectiveness.
- Consider the maintenance costs of projects before building them.
- Build more projects to increase your tax revenue, creating a sustainable economy.
- Balance short-term protection with long-term economic sustainability.
- Some projects become available in later turns, offering better protection.
- Pay attention to the visual cues on the town map to identify vulnerable areas.
- Watch for weather effects that indicate the type of climate event occurring.
- The game is designed to be unwinnable in the long run - see how many turns you can survive!

## Educational Context

This game is designed to illustrate several key concepts about climate adaptation:

1. **Adaptation is necessary but not sufficient**: While adaptation can delay the worst impacts of climate change, it cannot prevent them entirely.
2. **Resources are limited**: Towns and cities have finite budgets and must make difficult choices about which adaptation measures to implement.
3. **Climate impacts are diverse**: Different types of climate events require different adaptation strategies.
4. **Climate change is progressive**: The intensity and frequency of climate events increase over time.
5. **Maintenance matters**: Adaptation infrastructure requires ongoing maintenance and can be damaged by the very events it's designed to protect against.
6. **Visual understanding**: The visual representation of climate events and their impacts helps build intuition about the challenges of adaptation.
7. **Inevitable loss**: The game's inevitable ending reflects the reality that some climate impacts cannot be avoided, only delayed or mitigated.

## Visual Features

- **Dynamic Town Map**: Watch your coastal town evolve as you build projects and face climate events.
- **Weather Animations**: Experience visual representations of storms, flooding, and heatwaves.
- **Damage Effects**: See the impact of climate events on your infrastructure with visual damage indicators.
- **Project Icons**: Each type of adaptation project has a unique visual representation on the map.
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface adapts to different screen sizes for optimal playability.
